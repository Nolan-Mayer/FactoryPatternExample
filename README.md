# FactoryPatternExample
//Nolan Mayer//
//ALL CODE WAS WRITTEN BY ME//

This repository demonstrates the use of an factory pattern. 
Was tasked to write a series of classes utilizing an interface to showcase the factory pattern (encapsulates object creation by letting subclasses decide what objects to create)
This was written in JAVA, IDE Replit.
